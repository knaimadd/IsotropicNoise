# Isotropic Noise
Repository containing code written for my engineering thesis "Procedural maps generation in video games".

## perlin.jl, simplex.jl
Files with my implementation of Perlin Noise and Simplex Noise and some auxilary functions needed for visualization in my thesis.

## trueMonotile.jl
File containing algorithms for generation of aperiodic tesselation using hat tile.

## hatNoise.jl
File containing algorithms for generation of new noises that uses aperiodic grid. The new noises are much closer to being isotropic than classic noises (Perlin and Simplex).
